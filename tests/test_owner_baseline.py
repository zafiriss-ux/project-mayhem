"""Phase 4 owner baseline (ADR-0067 D3.4, D-091).

Before step 2 the owner's decisions were fingerprinted on unchanged ``main``
(commit 39aee23): for each DailyCoach golden, the ``days`` section, which holds every
morning's return value, Telegram text and event sequence; and the whole governance
golden. Phase 4 changes how the database stores athletes, never what the owner is told.

A step may rewrite the ``tables`` section of a DailyCoach golden (a new column, for
example) but must leave these fingerprints alone. If one changes, the step changed the
owner's behaviour: stop and ask Zaf before updating it (ADR-0067 D3.4).

# both approved by Zaf 2026-10-17: the owner's mornings became stricter on purpose
# (H2_MISSING with no HRV baseline, ADR-0065 cap on H4 days, baselines without today).
# After D-105 no session changes against D-106; only the logged baselines and texts do,
# and a first morning no longer sends the "check database health" RHR alert.
# D-112 (SG-11), approved by Zaf: with no load history TSB reaches governance as None, so the
# first mornings also log DATA_MISSING_CONSERVATIVE_H4; no session or Telegram text changes.
# D-127 (OW-M1), approved by Zaf 2026-10-23: the Telegram texts gain Markdown escapes (\_ \* \`
# \[) and nothing else; no session, lock or number changes. Before it, Telegram refused 33 of
# the 54 messages in these goldens; after it, none.
